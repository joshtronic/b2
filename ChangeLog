B Squared (b^2) ChangeLog
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
19-Oct-2003:  0.6.3 Released Today!
              The b^2 project has been suspended indefinately by myself, 
              although other people have been developing and advancing the
              software.  On that note, 0.6.3 is a license update.  b^2 is now
              being distributed under the GNU GPL 
              (http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html) to allow any new 
              development to continue, and be distributed.

25-Sep-2002:  0.6.1 & 0.6.2 Released Today!!!
              Resolved an issue with the profiles that wouldn't allow the use
              of double quotes (""), and the Yahoo! Pager name wasn't being
              recored in the database either.  The installer was broken, so I
              fixed it (a couple times) and released another version today.

24-Sep-2002:  It was a bug fixing extravaganza!!  Fixed a problem with the
              profile images (bad URL resulted in some errors).  Fixed a lone
              undefined index on the scheme admin.  Fixed the post thread and
              reply pages to filter HTML differently, and not result in lost
              data.  Fixed the registration so it won't allow user's to use the
              &nbsp; character in a username.  Fixed it so that you can have no
              schemes without having it go to a crazy color scheme.  Removed
              the Message Admin and made the TOS and FAQ flat files (they are
              in the ./language directory, so they can be translated later on
              when the language pack support is fully complete).

23-Sep-2002:  Was offered $500 bucks for the "rights" to b^2... I declined.

21-Sep-2002:  Changed some of the verbage on the view_forums page, and added a
              timestamp on the right side of the page.

19-Sep-2002:  Set the title of the pages to reflect the board name, and which
              version of b^2 it is running, instead of just "[ Forum ]".

18-Sep-2002:  Added a function to email the admin with an error.  At the moment
              it only emails the admin on MySQL errors, and the options aren't
              built into the installer yet.

17-Sep-2002:  Started implementing language packs to the board.  This will allow
              people to run the board in languages other than English.  The
              first thing to be migrated over is the installer, which is almost
              complete.

16-Sep-2002:  0.6.0 Released Today!!!
              Fixed a problem when there are no moderators for a forum, it was
              displaying errors instead of "--".

15-Sep-2002:  Fixed up the installer so it will let you download the config.php
              file with E_ALL on in the php.ini file.

14-Sep-2002:  Tweaked out some more issues with b^2 generating notices, and
              errors.

13-Sep-2002:  Fixed a boat load of issues when running b^2 on Windows 2000.  The
              issue turns out to be more of a PHP issue than anything.  If you
              have PHP set to issues all warnings and notices, then b^2 was
              having a lot of issues.  Now most (if not all) of those issues
              have been fixed.  Added a function to allow the easy retrieval of
              values from the super globals.

12-Sep-2002:  Same ol', same ol'.  Got the optimization done (well the portion
              I was working on), alond with the documentation audit.  Discovered
              some problems with installing b^2 on a Windows system (of course).
              More specifically, Windows NT/2000, running IIS, with the latest
              versions of PHP and MySQL.  I hope to have that resolved by the
              time 0.6.0 is ready to release.

11-Sep-2002:  Continued to do housecleaning on the existing code, and re-
              commenting parts of it.  Should be ready to go by tomorrow.

09-Sep-2002:  Started optimizing my over-use of the echo command.  And the
              people rejoiced!  Also, have been skimming the comments and 
              making sure they are accurate, and all that good stuff.  And the
              people rejoiced, again.

06-Sep-2002:  BETA-0.6.0 Released Today!!!
              Added table prefixes when installing, along with a few other new
              fields on the installation screen.  There is form validation when
              installing, and errors will be more descriptive (admin errors, not
              generic user error messages).  Quite a few miscellaneous bug fixes
              on top of everything else.  All the database calls have been 
              optimized, along with the error trapping (unless I overlooked
              something).  The installer now prompts the user to download the 
              config.php file if the script doesn't have permission to write to
              the file.  I was a bit disappointed with the original installer
              from 0.5.0, hence the early beta release of 0.6.0.  I felt the
              amount of code changes warrented the beta release, as opposed to
              version 0.5.1.

05-Sep-2002:  Continued my blitzkreig of code changes, most specifically,
              optimizing the database calls, and adding secure error trapping. 

04-Sep-2002:  Figured out the permissions problem when installing, the entire
              folder needs to have public write permission.  chmod 777 dir, then
              attempt to install, and everything works perfectly.  Started to 
              optimize / lock down the code for b^2.  I'm going through and
              adding error trapping, so the users will never interact with any
              technical error messages (which can pose a security risk).  Also
              added a function for doing database queries, and have been adding
              the static database variables to constants, instead of strings.

03-Sep-2002:  0.5.0 Released Today!!!
              Fixed a problem with the schemes, now if there are no active 
              schemes, the first scheme in the database will be set as the 
              active one (typically default).  Built the installer, which is 
              about 90% functional.  This means you can install the board, but 
              you have to make sure that the install.php file has the proper 
              permissions (chmod 666 install.php).  The script is lacking form 
              validation, and advanced error checking, which will allow a user 
              to download the config file if the script doesn't have the right 
              permissions.  Development (unstable) version 0.5.0 is being 
              packed up and shipped off to Freshmeat.net for it's initial 
              release.

02-Sep-2002:  Completed the scheme admin, with form checking and the like.  
              Added the General Admin section for updating the name of the 
              board, and the title image.  Fixed some bugs, and planned out the 
              installation process.  Now there is a config.php file that holds 
              the MySQL variables, along with the 'INSTALLED' global variable
              which tells the script if it needs to run the installed or not.

28-Aug-2002:  Added the scheme admin.  Changed the database slightly to include 
              a new table for board properties (title, title image, et cetera). 
              This is now a separate section from the schemes, which are fully
              operational now.  Was advised this evening, by one of the people
              stress testing the board, that their attempted buffer overruns
              resulted in lagging on their end.

27-Aug-2002:  Finished implementing changes to use customizable values for the 
              overall look and feel of the board.

26-Aug-2002:  Added more board properties to the database, 10 in all.  The board
              is pulling some of the properties from the database to generate 
              the page.  Ended up killing the properties table, and creating a 
              schemes table which holds all of the customizable information.  
              Started implementing system wide changes to accomodate.

24-Aug-2002:  Administrators now have the ability to add / remove moderators 
              and administrators, along with editting "messages" which is a new
              table in the database as well.  There are currently two messages, 
              Terms of Service, and FAQ, both of which can be customized by the
              board owner.  Fixed a problem with the KeepSafe function for 
              securing the board.

23-Aug-2002:  Added tag and escape character stripping on the forum admin. 
              Added a confirmation script for use with such things as the delete
              function on the forum admin.  Changed up the logo slightly as 
              well.  Fixed an error on the registration page that was 
              prohibiting new users to sign up.  Added user administration tools
              that allow administrators to edit all the user's profiles.

22-Aug-2002:  Changed the title logo again.  The new logo, IMHO, is the best
              one thus far.  Fully implemented the forum admin, allowing for the
              addition, removal, and modification of forums.  The forum admin
              is lacking input parsing which at the moment is leaving it a bit
              insecure, and messy, since it still posts \' and \".

21-Aug-2002:  Fixed a hole in the profile system, for editting and viewing.
              Added folder icons for the thread listing, four in all.  New
              threads, old threads, hot threads, and today's hot threads.  
              Fixed a problem with the page id's, should be the last time 
              anyone gets to see the internal path.  Added a bit more
              differentiation between the overlapping moderator and admin
              tools.  Now if a moderator / admin removed a thread, they will
              redirected to the thread, and not the forum list.  Deleting an
              entire thread redirects to the forum the thread was in, and not
              the forum list.  Finished adding the add signature by default
              options.  New users will be able to specify if they want to
              include their signature on new posts or not.  This can be updated
              any time via the profile editor.  Began adding administrative
              links across the top menu, which resulted in a problem with the
              login script, which was correct (user's weren't being verified 
              correctly upon login).  Implemented the forum order column in the
              database, hence the new order.  Began adding the forum editor for
              administrators, allowing them to add new forums, delete and
              modify existing ones.  Fixed a bug that caused the view replies
              page to freak out if a user was an administrator, but not a
              moderator.

20-Aug-2002:  Fixed some holes in the user verification portion of the code
              would allow any user to circumvent passworded areas and do things
              like post messages without having accounts, and possibly pose as
              existing users.  Added IP logging on all posts, which are only
              visible by the moderators for that particular forum.  Also began
              implementing moderator tools.  Right now, a moderator can delete
              an entire thread, or just certain replies to that thread. Added
              the administrators table to the database, and functionality so 
              that an admin can delete threads / replies on any forum, 
              regardless of their moderator status for that forum.

19-Aug-2002:  There were a couple of random fixes over the weekend, but nothing
              too important.  Today the user's table was modified to include
              a column that signifies if the user wants to add their signature
              to new messages by default.  There is currently no functionality
              to set this value when registering a new account, or via the
              profile editor.  Also modified the date format on replies.

16-Aug-2002:  Changed up the view threads page a bit, made the location and 
              new thread links on the same line.  Tweaked some of the table
              attributes, and fixed some bugs with the moderator list, and the
              last post for a forum.  Shortened the max length for thread titles
              from 128 characters, down to 64.  Added more signature 
              functionality; now you get the choice weather or not you want the 
              signature to be added to the end of your message, but you will 
              only get the option if you have a prexisting signature in the 
              database (might end up giving people without signatures the 
              opportunity to set one up, without loosing the message they were 
              about to post).  Fixed the double signature problem as well.

15-Aug-2002:  New logo / header / banner / image added today.  Again, nothing
              too fancy, I was a bit tired of the last image.  Now the main page
              displays the latest post time and user for each forum, and links
              all of the usernames to the profiles.  Fixed a problem with the 
              signatures, it was pulling the newest user's signature, instead of
              the correct signature for the user.  Now when previewing a new
              post, you are shown your signature along with your message.

14-Aug-2002:  Added more functionality when editting a profile when an image
              is involved.  Also added a view profiles page that will display
              a user's profile, if they are real users, users not in the 
              database will generate an error and alert the user.

13-Aug-2002:  Patched the bug in the view thread and reply pages that allowed
              a user to crash the script and reveal the path.  Added signatures
              to the user's profile, that auto-populate when the user posts a 
              new thread or reply.  Corrected a flaw when editting the
              submitted information when registering, it wasn't carrying over
              the "AOL Instant Messenger" field.  Users can now access their 
              profile, and edit the information in it.

12-Aug-2002:  Updated the registration and login code to support encrypted
              passwords.  The passwords are encrypted via the crypt() function
              with a random salt.  Added more checking to posting messages and
              registering a new account.  Justin pointed out that you can post 
              empty messages just by putting a space in the field.  When posting
              a new thread, or a reply, the HTML special characters are
              converted, which in turn eliminates the sight of \" and the like.
              All HTML is ignored with the exception of <BR>, only because the
              board supports people posting line breaks in their messages.
              Adding support for when there aren't any threads in a selected
              forum and added a moderator listing on the view forums page, even
              though there aren't any moderator functions yet.

11-Aug-2002:  Updated the database schemas (wiped all the existing data and
              started fresh), this included tweaking some of the tables, and 
              adding a moderators table, for when I implement forum moderators.
              When registering, users are prompted for more information, which 
              is shown when they post.  The registration form needs some work to
              ensure that people aren't trying to feed false information via the
              querystring.  Fixed a problem with the determining the total 
              number of posts. 

10-Aug-2002:  Updated a lot of the variable calls to comply with the new PHP 
              setting of register_globals being off.  Added some new code to the
              post thread and post reply pages to make sure the user isn't 
              feeding bad information via the querystring.  When someone 
              registers a new account, they will be forwarded back to the main 
              page (forum list) and have the option to automatically log in from
              that page (thanks Matt!).  When registering, the password is no 
              longer shown in plain text, and it must be at least 6 characters 
              long.

09-Aug-2002:  Added some directory security to the system.  Now if a user tries 
              to call any of the directories in the structure, other than root, 
              it will redirect them to the main page.  If the user attempts to 
              call any of the files directly, other than index.php they will be 
              redirected home as well.  JavaScript form validation has been 
              added to the post thread and reply forms, as well as code to make
              sure someone isn't trying to feed the form data via the 
              querystring.

08-Aug-2002:  Not only can user's sign up for an account, they can log in now
              too!  The login is working, but will need to be tweaked for 
              security purposes, plus most of the code built into the index.php
              will be added into the include file as a function.  Users can now
              post new threads to the forums, as well as reply to existing
              threads.  Fixed the problem with the forum list reporting the
              wrong number of posts.

07-Aug-2002:  Threw together a quick little banner / logo.  Built out the page
              to allow a user to sign up for an account.  The page checks the
              input from the user and all that good stuff, detecting malformed
              requests (i.e. hack attempts) and blocks them.  Registration only
              requires minimal information (username, password, email address)
              but will be expanded to support a full profile.  Users can now set
              up an account, but there are no actions for them yet.

06-Aug-2002:  Built out the database tables for the users, forums, threads, and
              replies.  Set up the directory structure. Built the index page, 
              along with the content pages to show the forum list, thread list, 
              and replies.
