B Squared (b^2) Thank yous...

Matt "Phone Zone" Naso		This is the guy I have to blame for this
<mnaso@tampabay.rr.com>         project.  I guess it's my own fault for saying I
                                was bored and in need of a new project.  Matt
                                proposed that I build a bulletin board (I was
                                going to at one time, but never did), and has
                                helped with testing the damn thing.

Justin				Justin's always been there to beta test, and
<fanderatm@hotmail.com>		find all my little screw ups (ass).  He's done
				good, and is part of the reason the board is
				deemed secure.

Dean (Geekoid)			This mofro is my partner in crime for the most
<dean@cleancode.org>		part.  He will eventually be a developer on the
				project, but for right now, he's just some guy
				who makes my life a bit more complicated, but
				he knows I love him ;)

Me				Well, the code didn't write itself... I've
<josh@cleancode.org>		invested a month of my life into this project
				and I'm a couple more months building upon it,
				I tend to think I deserve a thank you, too ;)
